# CrowdVote
COMP 3975 PHP Personal Project

Crowd Vote webapp is where users can enter in questions that they want the audience to answer. The user can enter a question with up to
four possible answers. The questions are randomly picked from the database.

The focus of this project was to demonstrate making a connection to the database and have the user interact
with the database. The design of the website wasn't a focus and why I left it as a minimal design.

This project uses PHP, mySQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
